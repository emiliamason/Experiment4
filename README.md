We created a product where couples who are in long distance relationships, can wear a bracelet that will vibrate and light up based on their partner's pulse. 

For this to work, you place on the bracelet (which looks like a Power Ranger watch) and attach the pulse sensor to your finger and through WIFI it will send the data to and from one another's bracelets. 

Even if you are not in a long distance relationship, but want to spice up your love life test out Lover Corner.
